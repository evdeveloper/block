                    <h2>What is a Coding Champion?</h2>
                    <p>A Coding Champion is a parent who, like us, believes that learning to code should be an essential part of every child’s development. They believe technology is the future. They believe that it’s our responsibility to provide opportunities for our kids to develop the skills they’ll need in an environment built for learning.</p>
                    <p>A Coding Champion is an advocate for bringing coding programs into schools so more kids can be exposed to computer programming, robotics, and technology education.</p>
